✅ Response:

The sun-kissed field, a sight to see,
The game begins, the crowd cheers free.
The bat and ball, a symphony,
As cricket’s magic sets the energy.

The bowler runs, a fiery pace,
The batsman swings, a smiling face.
The ball soars high, a perfect arc,
A six, and joy does embark.

The wicket falls, a sudden sound,
The fielders leap, their spirits bound.
The umpire’s call, a moment’s pause,
The game’s intensity, it never claws.

The spinners turn, a wily art,
The fast bowlers tear the heart.
The keeper crouches, eyes so keen,
To catch the edge, his only dream.

The batsmen walk, their will to fight,
To build a score, to make it right.
Each run a step, each boundary cheer,
The crowd’s delight, the players hear.

The captain leads, a guiding light,
To strategize, to win the fight.
The team unites, a common goal,
To conquer all, to touch the soul.

The tension mounts, the stakes are high,
Each ball a test, each moment dry.
The game of skill, the game of might,
A dance of wills, a wondrous sight.

The Pavilion stands, a noble grace,
Where legends born, their stories trace.
The field of dreams, where heroes rise,
Where cricket’s magic meets the skies.

The sun dips low, the day grows old,
The game unwinds, the tales are told.
The players leave, their hearts aglow,
For in this game, their spirit grows.

The crowd disperse, their voices fade,
The field lies still, the day is made.
But in their hearts, the love remains,
For cricket’s charm, its endless refrains.

The game of kings, the game of men,
Where passion flows, where friendships blend.
A game of life, a game of grace,
Where every moment holds its place.

The spirit lives, the love will grow,
For cricket’s heartbeat, it will always show.
In every ball, in every run,
The joy of cricket, it has just begun.
